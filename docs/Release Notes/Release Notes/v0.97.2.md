## üí° Key highlights

*   A new collection type has been added: a board in which child notes are grouped in columns.
*   Geo map now comes with a vector map by default.
    *   The vector styles will provide for a smoother experience, consult the documentation for more information.
    *   Apart from that, there are multiple styles to choose from in the _Collection properties_ section in the ribbon, including dark themes.
    *   Apart from that, added an option to display a scale on the map.
*   Jump to note was enhanced to allow triggering commands (such as the ones that can have a keyboard shortcut assigned to them) quickly.
    *   Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd> to test it out.
    *   The feature was renamed to simply ‚ÄúJump to‚Ä¶‚Äù to better accommodate the new role.
    *   For more information, check the user guide for ‚ÄúJump to‚Ä¶‚Äù.
