## üí° Key highlights

*   ‚ÄúBooks‚Äù have been renamed to Collections to better match their intentions.
    *   **A new collection was introduced,** _**table.**_
        *   See the in-app documentation for more information.
        *   Custom table theme for Trilium by @adoriandoran
    *   Geomap: The geomap was converted from a standalone note type to a collection.
    *   The collections are not displayed directly in ‚ÄúInsert child‚Äù in the note tree with predefined configuration such as promoted attributes to make them easier to use (e.g. for calendar, geomap).
*   A new editing mechanism was introduced: quick edit. This opens notes for editing in a popup instead of a tab, allowing easy access. This is especially useful for collections, to edit notes without switching context.
