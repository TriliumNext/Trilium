## üí° Key highlights

*   Presentations can now be created directly from within Trilium, including being able to present in full screen.
    *   Presentations are a new type of collections.
    *   For more information, consult the in-app documentation or the [online documentation](https://docs.triliumnotes.org/User%20Guide/User%20Guide/Note%20Types/Collections/Presentation%20View.html).
