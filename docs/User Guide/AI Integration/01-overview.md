An interactive AI assistant that can:
- Answer questions based on your note content
- Provide summaries of complex topics across multiple notes
- Help you discover connections between ideas
- Assist with research and analysis

#### 2. **Semantic Search**
Advanced search capabilities using embeddings:
- Find conceptually related notes even when exact keywords don't match
- Discover hidden connections between notes
- Retrieve relevant context automatically during conversations

#### 3. **Tool-Enabled Actions**
AI can perform actions within your knowledge base:
- Create new notes based on conversations
- Update existing note content
- Search and retrieve specific information
- Manage note attributes and relationships
- Work with calendar and date-based notes

#### 4. **Content Generation and Enhancement**
- Generate summaries of long notes
- Expand on ideas and concepts
- Help with writing and editing
- Create structured content from unstructured information

## Supported AI Providers and Models

### Cloud Providers

- **Embedding Models**: mxbai-embed-large, nomic-embed-text, all-minilm
- **Advantages**:
  - Complete privacy - runs entirely on your machine
  - No API costs
  - Full control over model selection
  - Works offline
- **Considerations**:
  - Requires local compute resources
  - May be slower than cloud providers
  - Model quality varies

## Use Cases for AI in Note-Taking

### Research and Learning
- **Literature Review**: Summarize and synthesize information from multiple research notes
- **Concept Exploration**: Ask questions to understand complex topics from different angles
- **Study Assistant**: Create practice questions, summaries, and explanations from study notes

### Knowledge Management
- **Information Retrieval**: Quickly find specific information across thousands of notes
- **Connection Discovery**: Identify relationships between seemingly unrelated notes
- **Content Organization**: Get suggestions for better organizing and structuring your notes

### Writing and Content Creation
- **Idea Development**: Expand on initial thoughts and brainstorm new directions
- **Draft Generation**: Create first drafts based on outline notes
- **Editing Assistance**: Improve clarity, structure, and flow of existing content

### Personal Productivity
- **Meeting Summaries**: Generate concise summaries from meeting notes
- **Task Extraction**: Identify action items from project notes
- **Daily Reviews**: Get AI-generated summaries of daily activities and progress

### Creative Projects
- **Story Development**: Explore plot ideas and character development
- **World Building**: Maintain consistency in creative universes
- **Idea Synthesis**: Combine concepts from different notes to generate new ideas

## Privacy and Security Considerations

### Data Control
- **Local Processing Options**: Use Ollama for complete privacy with no data leaving your machine
- **Note Exclusion**: Mark sensitive notes with `#excludeFromAI` label to prevent AI access
- **Provider Selection**: Choose between cloud and local providers based on your privacy needs

### Security Features
- **API Key Protection**: Encrypted storage of API keys
- **Session Isolation**: Each chat session is isolated and temporary
- **No Automatic Uploads**: Notes are only sent to AI providers when explicitly requested

### Best Practices
1. **Review Provider Policies**: Understand how each provider handles your data
2. **Use Local Models for Sensitive Data**: Consider Ollama for confidential information
3. **Label Sensitive Notes**: Use the exclusion label for notes that should never be processed by AI
4. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review which notes are being accessed by AI features

## Getting Started

To begin using AI features in Trilium:

1. **Enable AI Features**: Navigate to Options â†’ AI/LLM and enable the feature
2. **Choose a Provider**: Select between OpenAI, Anthropic, or Ollama based on your needs
3. **Configure Embeddings**: Set up embedding generation for semantic search
4. **Start Chatting**: Use the "Chat with Notes" button to begin interacting with your knowledge base

## Architecture Overview

The AI integration in Trilium follows a modular architecture:

### Three-Layer System
1. **Provider Layer**: Interfaces with different AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)
2. **Service Layer**: Manages conversations, context, and tool execution
3. **Integration Layer**: Connects AI capabilities with Trilium's core features

### Key Components
- **Chat Service**: Manages conversations and message history
- **Context Service**: Extracts and formats relevant note content
- **Tool Registry**: Enables AI to perform actions within Trilium
- **Embedding Service**: Generates and manages semantic embeddings
- **Model Capabilities**: Tracks and manages different model features

This architecture ensures flexibility, allowing you to switch providers or models while maintaining consistent functionality across the application.
