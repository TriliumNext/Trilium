# Lists
There are three types of lists supported by text notes:

*   <img src="7_Lists_image.png" width="17" height="13"> Bulleted lists (also known as unordered lists).
*   <img src="8_Lists_image.png" width="18" height="16"> Numbered lists (or ordered lists).
*   <img src="10_Lists_image.png" width="19" height="13"> To-do lists

For bulleted and numbered lists, it's possible to configure an alternative marker such as squares or Roman numbering by pressing the <img src="9_Lists_image.png" width="10" height="6"> icon. For numbered lists, it's also possible to specify the number to start at or whether to count in reverse order.

## Keyboard interaction

*   To create a new list:
    *   Bulleted list: Start a line with `*` or `-` followed by a space;
    *   Numbered list: Start a line with `1.` or `1)` followed by a space;
    *   To-do list: Start a line with `[ ]` for an unchecked item or `[x]` for a checked item.
*   To create a new item in the list, press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
*   To create a blank line within a list item, press <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>.
*   To exit out of the list, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> twice.
*   To merge two lists, simply delete the gap between them.
*   To create nested lists, simply use the <img src="2_Lists_image.png" width="17" height="14"> button (see _Indentation_ inÂ <a class="reference-link" href="Other%20features.md">Other features</a>) or the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key. To decrease the nesting level for the current element, press <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>.

## Headings, code blocks within lists

It possible to add content-level blocks such as headings, code blocks, tables within lists, as follows:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | ![](6_Lists_image.png) | First, create a list. |
| 2   | ![](4_Lists_image.png) | Press Enter to create a new list item. |
| 3   | ![](5_Lists_image.png) | Press Backspace to get rid of the bullet point. Notice the cursor position. |
| 4   | <img class="image_resized" style="aspect-ratio:676/112;width:98.29%;" src="1_Lists_image.png" width="676" height="112"> | At this point, insert any desired block-level item such as a code block. |
| 5   | <img class="image_resized" style="aspect-ratio:675/129;width:94.22%;" src="Lists_image.png" width="675" height="129"> | To continue with a new bullet point, press Enter until the cursor moves to a new blank position. |
| 6   | <img class="image_resized" style="aspect-ratio:675/129;width:100%;" src="3_Lists_image.png" width="675" height="129"> | Press Enter once more to create the new bullet. |

The same principle applies to all three list types (bullet, numbered and to-do).
