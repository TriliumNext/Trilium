# Internal (reference) links
Unlike external notes, internal links (links to other notes) can be created at the current position by :

1.  Pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> or the <img src="Internal (reference) links.png" width="20" height="17"> button from theÂ <a class="reference-link" href="../Formatting%20toolbar.md">Formatting toolbar</a>.
2.  Filling in the desired note to link. It's also possible to create notes from this dialog by typing a non-existing note title and selecting _Create and link child note_.

There are two link types, adjustable when creating the link to the note:

1.  _link title mirrors the note's current title_
    1.  This is sometimes also called "reference link".
    2.  Title of such links cannot be changed, instead it is always mirroring the title of linked note.
    3.  The icon of the note is also displayed.
    4.  The link title will automatically update if the title of the note is changed.
2.  _link title can be changed arbitrarily_
    1.  This is the traditional hyperlink, where the text of the link can be different to the note title.

Once an internal link is created:

*   You can follow the note link by double clicking it.
*   Alternatively if you only wish to quickly preview the content, you can hover over the link and will see read only preview.
