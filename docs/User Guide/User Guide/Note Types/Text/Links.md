# Links
There are two types of links:

*   <a class="reference-link" href="Links/External%20links.md">External links</a>, for standard hyperlinks to websites or other resources.
*   <a class="reference-link" href="Links/Internal%20(reference)%20links.md">Internal (reference) links</a> for links to other notes within Trilium.

## Pasting links

*   For internal links (links to notes in Trilium), press Ctrl+C in the <a class="reference-link" href="../../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/UI%20Elements/Note%20Tree.md">Note Tree</a>:
    *   Pasting directly in a text note will create a reference link (with an icon to the note and the actual note title).
    *   Pasting over an existing text will create a traditional link.
*   For external links:
    *   Paste the raw URL directly and press space to turn it into a link.
    *   Select a text and paste the URL over it to turn that text into a link.
    *   If you are pasting a formatted link (e.g. from the a webpage in a browser), simply paste it and it will keep the original text and URL.

## In-place linking

Trilium also provides "inline" linking - type `@` and you'll see an autocomplete, just type few characters from the desired note title, press enter and you have a link.

## Note map

Trilium provides a visualisation of incoming and outgoing links for a particular note. See [note map](../../Advanced%20Usage/Note%20Map%20\(Link%20map%2C%20Tree%20map\).md) for details.
