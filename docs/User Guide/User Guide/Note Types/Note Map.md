A Note map is a note type which displays a standalone version of the feature of the same name:Â [Note Map (Link map, Tree map)](../Advanced%20Usage/Note%20Map%20\(Link%20map%2C%20Tree%20map\).md).

Once created, the note map will display the relations between notes. Only the notes that are part of the parent of the note map will be displayed (including their children).

The labels `mapIncludeRelation` and `mapExcludeRelation`, if set, filter the note map to include only the specified relations or to exclude the specified relations, respectively.
