# Grid View
<figure class="image"><img style="aspect-ratio:990/590;" src="Grid View_image.png" width="990" height="590"></figure>

This view presents the child notes in a grid format, allowing for a more visual navigation experience.

Each tile contains:

*   The title of a note.
*   A snippet of the content.
*   For empty notes, the sub-children are also displayed, allowing for quick navigation.

Depending on the type of note:

*   For <a class="reference-link" href="../Text.md">Text</a> notes, the text can be slightly scrollable via the mouse wheel to reveal more context.
*   For <a class="reference-link" href="../Code.md">Code</a> notes, syntax highlighting is applied.
*   For <a class="reference-link" href="../File.md">File</a> notes, a preview is made available for audio, video and PDF notes.
*   If the note does not have a content, a list of its child notes will be displayed instead.

The grid view is also used by default in the <a class="reference-link" href="../../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/Notes/Note%20List.md">Note List</a> of every note, making it easy to navigate to children notes.

## Configuration

Unlike most other view types, the grid view is not actually configurable.
