# List View
<figure class="image"><img style="aspect-ratio:1387/758;" src="List View_image.png" width="1387" height="758"></figure>

List view is similar to <a class="reference-link" href="Grid%20View.md">Grid View</a>, but in the list view mode, each note is displayed in a single row with only the title and the icon of the note being visible by the default. By pressing the expand button it's possible to view the content of the note, as well as the children of the note (recursively).

In the example above, the "Node.js" note on the left panel contains several child notes. The right panel displays the content of these child notes as a single continuous document.

## Interaction

*   Each note can be expanded or collapsed by clicking on the arrow to the left of the title.
*   In the <a class="reference-link" href="../../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/UI%20Elements/Ribbon.md">Ribbon</a>, in the _Collection_ tab there are options to expand and to collapse all notes easily.
