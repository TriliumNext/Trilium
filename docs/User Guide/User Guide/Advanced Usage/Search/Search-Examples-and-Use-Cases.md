## Search Strategy Tips

### Building Effective Queries
1. **Start Specific**: Begin with the most selective criteria
2. **Add Gradually**: Build complexity incrementally
3. **Test Components**: Verify each part of complex queries
4. **Use Shortcuts**: Leverage `#` and `~` shortcuts for efficiency

### Performance Optimization
1. **Use Fast Search**: For large databases, enable fast search when content isn't needed
2. **Limit Results**: Add limits to prevent overwhelming result sets
3. **Order Strategically**: Put the most useful results first
4. **Cache Common Queries**: Save frequently used searches

### Maintenance Patterns
Regular queries for note maintenance:

```
# Weekly cleanup check
note.attributeCount = 0 note.type=text note.contentSize < 100 note.dateModified < TODAY-30

# Monthly project review  
#project #status=active note.dateModified < TODAY-30

# Quarterly archive review
note.isArchived=false note.dateModified < TODAY-90 note.childrenCount = 0
```
