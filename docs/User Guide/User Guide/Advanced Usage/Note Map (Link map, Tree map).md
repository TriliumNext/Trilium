# Note Map (Link map, Tree map)
Note map is a visualisation of connections between notes.

This provides an insight into a structure ("web") of notes.

There are two types of note map:

*   Link Map, which shows relations between notes.
*   Note Map, which shows the hierarchical tree structure.

## Link Map

The Link map is a visualization of links and <a class="reference-link" href="Attributes/Relations.md">Relations</a> incoming to and outgoing from a particular note.

The map indicates the following types of relations:

*   <a class="reference-link" href="../Note%20Types/Text/Links/Internal%20(reference)%20links.md">Internal (reference) links</a> between notes.
*   <a class="reference-link" href="Attributes/Relations.md">Relations</a>

## Tree Map

Shows hierarchical map of notes:

## Dedicated note type

Apart from the note map feature which can be accessed from any note, it is also possible to create a dedicated note which will display the relations in full screen. See [Note Map](../Note%20Types/Note%20Map.md) for more information.

[Relation map](../Note%20Types/Relation%20Map.md) is a similar concept, with some differences:

*   note map is automatically generated while relation map must be created manually
*   relation map is a type of note while a link map is just virtual visualization
