# Gallery
## Gallery View

The Gallery View displays visual notes (images, canvases, mermaid diagrams, and mind maps) as a grid of thumbnails, making it ideal for browsing and managing collections of visual content such as photo albums, artwork, or diagram collections.

## Supported note types

The gallery automatically displays thumbnails for the following note types:

*   <a class="reference-link" href="../Note%20Types/Mermaid%20Diagrams.md">Mermaid Diagrams</a>
*   <a class="reference-link" href="../Note%20Types/Mind%20Map.md">Mind Map</a>
*   <a class="reference-link" href="../Note%20Types/Canvas.md">Canvas</a>
*   <a class="reference-link" href="../Note%20Types/File.md">File</a> (image types)

Nested gallery collections are also displayed as folder tiles with a count of their visual contents, allowing you to organize visual content hierarchically.

## Interaction

*   **Click** on a thumbnail to open the note.
*   **Ctrl+Click** (or **Cmd+Click** on Mac) to add or remove individual notes from the selection.
*   **Shift+Click** to select a range of notes between the last selected note and the clicked note.
*   **Right-click** to access the context menu with options to open in a new window, rename, share, or delete notes.

### Selection mode

When notes are selected, the toolbar displays:

*   The count of selected items.
*   A **Clear Selection** button to deselect all.
*   A **Delete Selected** button to delete all selected notes at once.

Use **Select All** to quickly select all items in the gallery.
