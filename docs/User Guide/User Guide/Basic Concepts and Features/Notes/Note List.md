# Note List

When a note has one or more child notes, they will be listed at the end of the note for easy navigation.

## Configuration

*   To hide the note list for a particular note, simply apply the `hideChildrenOverview` [label](../../Advanced%20Usage/Attributes.md).
*   For some view types, such as Grid view, only a subset of notes will be displayed and pagination can be used to navigate through all of them for performance reasons. To adjust the number of notes per page, set `pageSize` to the desired number.

## View types

The view types dictate how the child notes are represented. By default, the notes will be displayed in a grid, however there are also some other view types available.

Generally the view type can only be changed in a <a class="reference-link" href="../../Note%20Types/Collections.md">Collections</a> note from the <a class="reference-link" href="../UI%20Elements/Ribbon.md">Ribbon</a>, but it can also be changed manually on any type of note using the `#viewType` attribute.
