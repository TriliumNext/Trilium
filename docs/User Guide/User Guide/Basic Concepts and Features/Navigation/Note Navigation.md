# Note Navigation
One of the Trilium's goals is to provide fast and comfortable navigation between notes.

## Backwards and forward

You can use alt-left and alt-right to move back and forward in history of viewed pages.

This works identically to browser backwards / forwards, it's actually using built-in browser support for this.

## Jump to note

This is useful to quickly find and view arbitrary notes - click on `Jump to` button on the top or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> . Then type part of the note name and autocomplete will help you pick the desired note.

See <a class="reference-link" href="Jump%20to.md">Jump to Note</a> for more information.
