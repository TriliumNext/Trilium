# Error logs
It's important to provide all available error logs together with bug reports.

There are two types of error logs, both of which are useful when reporting bugs.

*   <a class="reference-link" href="Error%20logs/Backend%20(server)%20logs.md">Backend (server) logs</a>
*   <a class="reference-link" href="Error%20logs/Frontend%20logs.md">Frontend logs</a>

## Providing sensitive data

If you don't feel comfortable attaching the logs or anything sensitive to the public GitHub issues, feel free to contact the devs in our Matrix [support channel](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Trilium#-discuss-with-us).

Use this email to also provide anything which could assist in analysing the bug - e.g. files/images/ZIPs being imported or [anonymized database](Anonymized%20Database.md).

### Exporting note subtree for reproduction

Often times, bugs manifest themselves in specific notes and having them would greatly ease reproduction and fixing.

In such case, please export the relevant note subtree by right-clicking it on the left tree, choosing Export - HTML as ZIP:
