## How to commit

For commit use prefixes in commit messages to provide context and clarity about the changes made to the code. This convention involves using short, descriptive prefixes such as

-   `Add:` for new features
-   `Update:` for modifications to existing functionality
-   `Improvement:` for code improvements
-   `Fix:` for bug fixes
-   `Integration:` for integration
-   `Remove:` for deleting code or features
-   `Docs:` for documentation updates

By following a consistent commit message convention, developers can efficiently track changes to the code and easily understand the navigate of modifications made over time.
