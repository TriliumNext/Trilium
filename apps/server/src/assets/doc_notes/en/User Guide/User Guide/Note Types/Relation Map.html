<p>Relation map is a type of&nbsp;note&nbsp;which visualizes notes and their
  <a
  href="#root/_help_zEY4DaJG4YT5">relations</a>.</p>
<h2>Interaction</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To create a new note and add it to the board, press the plus button in
    the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_XpOYSgsLkTJy">Floating buttons</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Afterwards, click anywhere on the map to place it there.</li>
      <li>The note will be placed as a sub-child of the map.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>An existing note can also be dragged from the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
    href="#root/_help_oPVyFC7WL2Lp">Note Tree</a>. It will be placed at the
    position it's dragged on.
    <ul>
      <li>Multiple notes can also be dragged via&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
        href="#root/_help_yTjUdsOi4CIE">Multiple selection</a>. The notes will
        be positioned near the dragged position without overlapping.</li>
      <li>The dragged note can be a sub-child of the map, or it can be at any arbitrary
        position.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To create a relationship, hold the mouse on the box on the right of a
    note and then:
    <ul>
      <li>Drag it over another note to create a relationship pointing from the first
        note to the second one.</li>
      <li>Drag over the same note to create a self-referencing relationship (represented
        as a loop).</li>
      <li>Once dragged, enter the name of the relationship to create. To cancel,
        simply dismiss the dialog or press <kbd>Esc</kbd>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To open a note, either click on the note (opening it in the current view)
    or use the right click menu to open in a new tab.</li>
  <li>To edit the title of a note or to delete it (either from the map, or delete
    it completely), right click the note.</li>
  <li>To delete a relationship, right click it and select the corresponding
    option.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Development process demo</h2>
<p>This is a basic example how you can create simple diagram using relation
  maps:</p>
<img src="1_Relation Map_relation-map-.png" width="934" height="667">
<p>And this is how you can create it:</p>
<img src="1_Relation Map_relation-map-.gif"
width="812" height="585">
<p>We start completely from scratch by first creating new note called "Development
  process" and changing its type to "Relation map". After that we create
  new notes one by one and place them by clicking into the map. We also drag
  <a
  href="#root/_help_zEY4DaJG4YT5">relations</a>between notes and name them. That's all!</p>
<p>Items on the map - "Specification", "Development", "Testing" and "Demo"
  are actually notes which have been created under "Development process"
  note - you can click on them and write some content. Connections between
  notes are called "<a href="#root/_help_zEY4DaJG4YT5">relations</a>".</p>
<h2>Family demo</h2>
<p>This is more complicated demo using some advanced concepts. Resulting
  diagram is here:</p>
<img src="Relation Map_relation-map-.png" width="941"
height="758">
<p>This is how you get to it:</p>
<img src="Relation Map_relation-map-.gif"
width="812" height="585">
<p>There are several steps here:</p>
<ul>
  <li>we start with empty relation map and two existing notes representing Prince
    Philip and Queen Elizabeth II. These two notes already have <code>isPartnerOf</code> 
    <a
    href="#root/_help_zEY4DaJG4YT5">relations</a>defined.
      <ul>
        <li>There are actually two "inverse" relations (one from Philip to Elizabeth
          and one from Elizabeth to Philip)</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>we drag both notes to relation map and place to suitable position. Notice
    how the existing <code>isPartnerOf</code> relations are displayed.</li>
  <li>now we create new note - we name it "Prince Charles" and place it on the
    relation map by clicking on the desired position. The note is by default
    created under the relation map note (visible in the note tree on the left).</li>
  <li>we create two new relations <code>isChildOf</code> targeting both Philip
    and Elizabeth
    <ul>
      <li>now there's something unexpected - we can also see the relation to display
        another <code>hasChild</code> relation. This is because there's a <a href="#root/_help_OFXdgB2nNk1F">relation definition</a> which
        puts <code>isChildOf</code> as an "<a href="#root/_help_OFXdgB2nNk1F">inverse</a>"
        relation of <code>hasChildOf</code> (and vice versa) and thus it is created
        automatically.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>we create another note for Princess Diana and create <code>isPartnerOf</code> relation
    from Charles. Again notice how the relation has arrows both ways - this
    is because <code>isPartnerOf</code> definition specifies its inverse relation
    as again "isPartnerOf" so the opposite relation is created automatically.</li>
  <li>as the last step we pan &amp; zoom the map to fit better to window dimensions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Relation definitions mentioned above come from "Person template" note
  which is assigned to any child of "My Family Tree" relation note. You can
  play with the whole thing in the <a href="#root/_help_wX4HbRucYSDD">demo notes</a>.</p>
<h2>Details</h2>
<p>You can specify which relations should be displayed with comma delimited
  names of relations in <code>displayRelations</code> label.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can specify comma delimited list of relation names
  in <code>hideRelations</code> which will display all relations, except for
  the ones defined in the label.</p>
