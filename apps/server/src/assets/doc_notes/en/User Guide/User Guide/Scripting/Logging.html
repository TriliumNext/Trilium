<p>The API log feature integrates with the script editor and it displays
  all the messages logged via <code>api.log</code>. This works for both back-end
  and front-end scripts.</p>
<p>The API log panel will appear after executing a script that uses <code>api.log</code> and
  it can be dismissed temporarily by pressing the close button in the top-right
  of the panel.</p>
<p>Apart from strings, an object can be passed as well in which case it will
  be pretty-formatted if possible (e.g. recursive objects are not supported).</p>
<h2>Console logging</h2>
<p>For logs that are not directly visible to the user, the standard <code>console.log</code> can
  be used as well.</p>
<ul>
  <li>For front-end scripts, the log will be shown in the Developer Tools (also
    known as Inspect).</li>
  <li>For back-end scripts, the log will be shown in the server output while
    running but <strong>will not</strong> be visible in the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
