<p>In certain scenarios, understanding the structure of a database is crucial
  for troubleshooting issues. However, sharing your actual <a href="#root/_help_wX4HbRucYSDD">database</a> file
  with personal notes is not advisable. To address this, Trilium offers a
  feature to anonymize the database. This feature can be accessed via Menu
  -&gt; Options -&gt; Advanced tab.</p>
<p>This feature creates a copy of your database with all sensitive data removed.
  Specifically, it strips out note titles, contents, revisions, history,
  and some non-system attributes while retaining the overall structure and
  metadata, such as modification dates. After anonymization, the database
  undergoes a <a href="https://sqlite.org/lang_vacuum.html">vacuuming process</a> to
  ensure no sensitive data remnants remain in the file. The anonymized database
  is saved in the <code>anonymized</code> directory within the <a href="#root/_help_tAassRL4RSQL">data directory</a>,
  making it safe to share with bug reports.</p>
<p>This will create a copy of your document and remove all sensitive data
  (currently note titles, contents, revisions, history and some of the options,
  and non-system attributes) while leaving all structure and metadata (e.g.
  date of last change). After this is done, the database is <a href="https://sqlite.org/lang_vacuum.html">VACUUMed</a> to
  make sure there's no stale sensitive data in the document file. The resulting
  file is stored in <code>anonymized</code> directory (placed in the <a href="#root/_help_tAassRL4RSQL">data directory</a>).
  You can safely attach it to a bug report.</p>
<h2>Command Line Anonymization</h2>
<p>If your <a href="#root/_help_wX4HbRucYSDD">database</a> is corrupted to the point
  where Trilium cannot start, the anonymization process can still be executed
  via the command line:</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-trilium-auto">node src/anonymize.js</code></pre>
<p>Run this command from the directory containing Trilium's source files,
  typically found in the <code>resources/app</code> directory for desktop builds.</p>
