<h2>Legacy ARM support</h2>
<p>The Docker builds also provide <code>linux/arm/v7</code> and <code>linux/arm/v8</code> platforms.
  These platforms are considered legacy since Trilium uses Node.js version
  24 which have <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/commit/6682861d6f">officially downgraded support</a> for
  these platforms to “experimental”.</p>
<p>As a result, Trilium needs to use Node.js 22 for these versions. As soon
  as soon Node.js 22 will no longer be compatible, support for <code>armv7</code> and <code>armv8</code> will
  be dropped entirely.</p>
<p>Regardless of upstream support, these platforms are supported on a best-effort
  basis and are not officially supported by the Trilium development team.
  Bug reports are accepted but they will not be treated with priority; contributions
  are welcome.</p>
