<h2>Matching your version with the cloud instance</h2>
<p>Please note that once you set up&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/pOsGYCXsbNQG/Otzi9La2YAUX/_help_cbkrhQjrkKrh">Synchronization</a>&nbsp;between
  a cloud instance and <a href="#root/pOsGYCXsbNQG/Otzi9La2YAUX/_help_poXkQfguuA0U">desktop</a> clients,
  it's important that the version of the desktop application and the server
  match up.</p>
<p>When setting up a cloud instance, it's best to check the version of the
  server by accessing it via a web browser and going to the <em>About</em> section.
  It's best that both the desktop and the server have the same <em>App version</em>;
  however it's generally OK to update the desktop to a newer version than
  the server if it has the same <em>Sync version</em>.</p>
<p>If the <em>Sync version</em> between the server and the desktop application
  doesn't match, synchronization will not work.</p>
