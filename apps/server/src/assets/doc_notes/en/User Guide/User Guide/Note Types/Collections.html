<p>Collections are a unique type of notes that don't have a content, but
  instead display its child notes in various presentation methods.</p>
<p>Classic collections are read-only mode and compiles the contents of all
  child notes into one continuous view. This makes it ideal for reading extensive
  information broken into smaller, manageable segments.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_8QqnMzx393bx">Grid View</a>&nbsp;which
    is the default presentation method for child notes (see&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
    href="#root/_help_0ESUbbAxVnoK">Note List</a>), where the notes are displayed
    as tiles with their title and content being visible.</li>
  <li><a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_mULW0Q3VojwY">List View</a>&nbsp;is
    similar to&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_8QqnMzx393bx">Grid View</a>,
    but it displays the notes one under the other with the content being expandable/collapsible,
    but also works recursively.</li>
</ul>
<p>More specialized collections were introduced, such as the:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_xWbu3jpNWapp">Calendar View</a>&nbsp;which
    displays a week, month or year calendar with the notes being shown as events.
    New events can be added easily by dragging across the calendar.</li>
  <li><a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_81SGnPGMk7Xc">Geo Map View</a>&nbsp;which
    displays a geographical map in which the notes are represented as markers/pins
    on the map. New events can be easily added by pointing on the map.</li>
  <li><a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_2FvYrpmOXm29">Table View</a>&nbsp;displays
    each note as a row in a table, with&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_OFXdgB2nNk1F">Promoted Attributes</a>&nbsp;being
    shown as well. This makes it easy to visualize attributes of notes, as
    well as making them easily editable.</li>
  <li><a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_CtBQqbwXDx1w">Board View</a>&nbsp;(Kanban)
    displays notes in columns, grouped by the value of a label.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a quick presentation of all the supported view types, see the child
  notes of this help page, including screenshots.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>To adjust the view type, see the dedicated <em>Collections</em> tab in the&nbsp;
  <a
  class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_BlN9DFI679QC">Ribbon</a>.</p>
<h2>Use cases</h2>
<h3>Creating a new collection</h3>
<p>To create a new collections, right click in the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
  href="#root/_help_oPVyFC7WL2Lp">Note Tree</a>&nbsp;and look for the <em>Collections</em> entry
  and select the desired type.</p>
<h3>Adding a description to a collection</h3>
<p>To add a text before the collection, for example to describe it:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a new collection.</li>
  <li>In the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_BlN9DFI679QC">Ribbon</a>,
    go to <em>Basic Properties</em> and change the note type from <em>Collection</em> to <em>Text</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now the text will be displayed above while still maintaining the collection
  view.</p>
<h3>Using saved search</h3>
<p>Collections, by default, only display the child notes. However, it is
  possible to use the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_eIg8jdvaoNNd">Search</a>&nbsp;functionality
  to display notes all across the tree, with advanced querying functionality.</p>
<p>To do so, simply start a&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_eIg8jdvaoNNd">Search</a>&nbsp;and
  go to the <em>Collection Properties</em> tab in the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
  href="#root/_help_BlN9DFI679QC">Ribbon</a>&nbsp;and select a desired type
  of collection. To keep the search-based collection, use a&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
  href="#root/_help_m523cpzocqaD">Saved Search</a>.</p>
<aside class="admonition important">
  <p>While in search, none of the collections will not display the child notes
    of the search results. The reason is that the search might hit a note multiple
    times, causing an exponential rise in the number of results.</p>
</aside>
<h3>Creating a collection from scratch</h3>
<p>By default, collections come with a default configuration and sometimes
  even sample notes. To create a collection completely from scratch:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a new note of type <em>Text</em> (or any type).</li>
  <li>In the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_BlN9DFI679QC">Ribbon</a>,
    go to <em>Basic Properties</em> and select <em>Collection</em> as the note
    type.</li>
  <li>Still in the ribbon, go to <em>Collection Properties</em> and select the
    desired view type.</li>
  <li>Consult the help page of the corresponding view type in order to understand
    how to configure them.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Archived notes</h2>
<p>By default, archived notes will not be shown in collections. This behaviour
  can be changed by going to <em>Collection Properties</em> in the&nbsp;
  <a
  class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_BlN9DFI679QC">Ribbon</a>&nbsp;and checking <em>Show archived notes</em>.</p>
<p>Archived notes will be generally indicated by being greyed out as opposed
  to the normal ones.</p>
<h2>Under the hood</h2>
<p>Collections by themselves are simply notes with no content that rely on
  the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_0ESUbbAxVnoK">Note List</a>&nbsp;mechanism
  (the one that lists the children notes at the bottom of a note) to display
  information.</p>
<p>By default, new collections use predefined&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
  href="#root/_help_KC1HB96bqqHX">Templates</a>&nbsp;that are stored safely
  in the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_2mUhVmZK8RF3">Hidden Notes</a>&nbsp;to
  define some basic configuration such as the type of view, but also some&nbsp;
  <a
  class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_OFXdgB2nNk1F">Promoted Attributes</a>&nbsp;to make editing easier.</p>
<p>Collections don't store their configuration (e.g. the position on the
  map, the hidden columns in a table) in the content of the note itself,
  but as attachments.</p>
