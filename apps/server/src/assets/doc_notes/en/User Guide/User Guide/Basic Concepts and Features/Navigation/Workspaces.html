<p>Workspace is a concept built up on top of <a href="#root/_help_OR8WJ7Iz9K4U">note hoisting</a>.
  It is based on the idea that a user has several distinct spheres of interest.
  An example might be "Personal" and "Work", these two spheres are quite
  distinct and don't interact together. When I focus on Work, I don't really
  care about personal notes.</p>
<p>So far workspace consists of these features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="#root/_help_OR8WJ7Iz9K4U">note hoisting</a> - you can "zoom" into
      a workspace subtree to focus only on the relevant notes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>easy entering of workspace:&nbsp;</p>
