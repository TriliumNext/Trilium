<p>It's important to provide all available error logs together with bug reports.</p>
<p>There are two types of error logs, both of which are useful when reporting
  bugs.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_bnyigUA2UK7s">Backend (server) logs</a>
  </li>
  <li><a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_9yEHzMyFirZR">Frontend logs</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Providing sensitive data</h2>
<p>If you don't feel comfortable attaching the logs or anything sensitive
  to the public GitHub issues, feel free to contact the devs in our Matrix
  <a
  href="https://github.com/TriliumNext/Trilium#-discuss-with-us">support channel</a>.</p>
<p>Use this email to also provide anything which could assist in analysing
  the bug - e.g. files/images/ZIPs being imported or <a href="#root/_help_x59R8J8KV5Bp">anonymized database</a>.</p>
<h3>Exporting note subtree for reproduction</h3>
<p>Often times, bugs manifest themselves in specific notes and having them
  would greatly ease reproduction and fixing.</p>
<p>In such case, please export the relevant note subtree by right-clicking
  it on the left tree, choosing Export - HTML as ZIP:</p>
