<p>It's important to provide all available error logs together with bug reports.
  This page will show you how to do it.</p>
<h2>Backend logs</h2>
<p>Open <a href="#root/_help_tAassRL4RSQL">data directory</a>, go to <code>log</code> subdirectory
  and find the latest log file, e.g. <code>trilium-2022-12-14.log</code>.
  You can attach the whole file to the bug report (preferable) or open it
  and copy-paste only the last lines / lines you believe are relevant.</p>
<p>If you have trouble finding it the log files, there's also an in-app option
  in top-left menu button -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Show backend log.</p>
<h2>Frontend logs</h2>
<p>To provide frontend logs, we need to open the Developer Console. Often
  the easiest way is to press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Shift</kbd>-<kbd>I</kbd> which
  should work in most browsers (and desktop app). Make sure that the error
  producing action happened right before you copy&amp;paste the errors, the
  console is cleared on app restart.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, then:</p>
<ul>
  <li>in Trilium desktop app, go to top-left menu button -&gt; Advanced -&gt;
    Open Dev Tools</li>
  <li>In Firefox/Chrome right-click anywhere in the page and click Inspect:</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>Once you have Dev Tools open, click on "Console" tab:</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Copy-paste (or screenshot) the logs. It's better to provide not just errors,
  but the whole log, which might provide context while analyzing the bug.</p>
<h2>Providing sensitive data</h2>
<p>If you don't feel comfortable attaching the logs or anything sensitive
  to the public GitHub issues, feel free to contact the devs in our Matrix
  <a
  href="https://github.com/TriliumNext/Trilium#-discuss-with-us">support channel</a>.</p>
<p>Use this email to also provide anything which could assist in analysing
  the bug - e.g. files/images/ZIPs being imported or <a href="#root/_help_x59R8J8KV5Bp">anonymized database</a>.</p>
<h3>Exporting note subtree for reproduction</h3>
<p>Often times, bugs manifest themselves in specific notes and having them
  would greatly ease reproduction and fixing.</p>
<p>In such case, please export the relevant note subtree by right-clicking
  it on the left tree, choosing Export - HTML as ZIP:</p>
