<p>To provide frontend logs, we need to open the Developer Console. Often
  the easiest way is to press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Shift</kbd>-<kbd>I</kbd> which
  should work in most browsers (and desktop app). Make sure that the error
  producing action happened right before you copy&amp;paste the errors, the
  console is cleared on app restart.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, then:</p>
<ul>
  <li>in Trilium desktop app, go to top-left menu button -&gt; Advanced -&gt;
    Open Dev Tools</li>
  <li>In Firefox/Chrome right-click anywhere in the page and click Inspect:</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have Dev Tools open, click on "Console" tab:</p>

<p>Copy-paste (or screenshot) the logs. It's better to provide not just errors,
  but the whole log, which might provide context while analyzing the bug.</p>
