<p>When a note has one or more child notes, they will be listed at the end
  of the note for easy navigation.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To hide the note list for a particular note, simply apply the <code>hideChildrenOverview</code> 
    <a
    href="#root/_help_zEY4DaJG4YT5">label</a>.</li>
  <li>For some view types, such as Grid view, only a subset of notes will be
    displayed and pagination can be used to navigate through all of them for
    performance reasons. To adjust the number of notes per page, set <code>pageSize</code> to
    the desired number.</li>
</ul>
<h2>View types</h2>
<p>The view types dictate how the child notes are represented. By default,
  the notes will be displayed in a grid, however there are also some other
  view types available.</p>
<p>Generally the view type can only be changed in a&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
  href="#root/_help_GTwFsgaA0lCt">Collections</a>&nbsp;note from the&nbsp;
  <a
  class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_BlN9DFI679QC">Ribbon</a>, but it can also be changed manually on any type of note using
    the <code>#viewType</code> attribute.</p>
