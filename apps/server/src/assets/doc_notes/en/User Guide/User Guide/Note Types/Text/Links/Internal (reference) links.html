<p>Unlike external notes, internal links (links to other notes) can be created
  at the current position by :</p>
<ol>
  <li>Pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> or the
    <img src="Internal (reference) links.png"
    width="20" height="17">button from the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_nRhnJkTT8cPs">Formatting toolbar</a>.</li>
  <li>Filling in the desired note to link. It's also possible to create notes
    from this dialog by typing a non-existing note title and selecting <em>Create and link child note</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two link types, adjustable when creating the link to the note:</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>link title mirrors the note's current title</em>
    <ol>
      <li>This is sometimes also called "reference link".</li>
      <li>Title of such links cannot be changed, instead it is always mirroring
        the title of linked note.</li>
      <li>The icon of the note is also displayed.</li>
      <li>The link title will automatically update if the title of the note is changed.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><em>link title can be changed arbitrarily</em>
    <ol>
      <li>This is the traditional hyperlink, where the text of the link can be different
        to the note title.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Once an internal link is created:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can follow the note link by double clicking it.</li>
  <li>Alternatively if you only wish to quickly preview the content, you can
    hover over the link and will see read only preview.</li>
</ul>
