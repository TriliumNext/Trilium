<p>Note map is a visualisation of connections between notes.</p>
<p>This provides an insight into a structure ("web") of notes.</p>
<p>There are two types of note map:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Link Map, which shows relations between notes.</li>
  <li>Note Map, which shows the hierarchical tree structure.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Link Map</h2>
<p>Shows <a href="#root/_help_zEY4DaJG4YT5">relations</a> between notes:</p>

</p>
<h2>Tree Map</h2>
<p>Shows hierarchical map of notes:</p>

<h2>Dedicated note type</h2>
<p>Apart from the note map feature which can be accessed from any note, it
  is also possible to create a dedicated note which will display the relations
  in full screen. See&nbsp;<a href="#root/_help_bdUJEHsAPYQR">Note Map</a>&nbsp;for
  more information.</p>

<p><a href="#root/_help_iRwzGnHPzonm">Relation map</a> is a similar concept, with
  some differences:</p>
<ul>
  <li>note map is automatically generated while relation map must be created
    manually</li>
  <li>relation map is a type of note while a link map is just virtual visualization</li>
</ul>
