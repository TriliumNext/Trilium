<p>Inheritance refers to the process of having a <a href="#root/_help_HI6GBBIduIgv">label</a> or
  a <a href="#root/_help_Cq5X6iKQop6R">relation</a> shared across multiple notes,
  generally in parent-child relations (or anywhere if using templates).</p>
<h2>Standard Inheritance</h2>
<p>In Trilium, attributes can be automatically inherited by child notes if
  they have the <code>isInheritable</code> flag set to <code>true</code>. This
  means the attribute (a key-value pair) is applied to the note and all its
  descendants.</p>
<p>To make an attribute inheritable, simply use the visual editor for&nbsp;
  <a
  class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_HI6GBBIduIgv">Labels</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_Cq5X6iKQop6R">Relations</a>.
    Alternatively, the attribute can be manually defined where <code>#myLabel=value</code> becomes <code>#myLabel(inheritable)=value</code> when
    inheritable.</p>
<p>As an example, the <code>archived</code> label can be set to be inheritable,
  allowing you to hide a whole subtree of notes from searches and other dialogs
  by applying this label at the top level.</p>
<p>Standard inheritance forces all the notes that are children (and sub-children)
  of a note to have that particular label or relation. If there is a need
  to have some notes not inherit one of the labels, then <em>copying inheritance</em> or <em>template inheritance</em> needs
  to be used instead.</p>
<h2>Copying Inheritance</h2>
<p>Copying inheritance differs from standard inheritance by using a <code>child:</code> prefix
  in the attribute name. This prefix causes new child notes to automatically
  receive specific attributes from the parent note. These attributes are
  independent of the parent and will persist even if the note is moved elsewhere.</p>
<p>If a parent note has the label <code>#child:exampleAttribute</code>, all
  newly created child notes (one level deep) will inherit the <code>#exampleAttribute</code> label.
  This can be useful for setting default properties for notes in a specific
  section.</p>
<p>Similarly, for relations use <code>~child:myRelation</code>.</p>
<p>Due to the way it's designed, copying inheritance cannot be used to cascade
  infinitely within a hierarchy. For that use case, consider using either
  standard inheritance or templates.</p>
<h3>Chained inheritance</h3>
<p>It is possible to define labels across multiple levels of depth. For example, <code>#child:child:child:foo</code> applied
  to a root note would create:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>#child:child:foo</code> on the first-level children.</li>
  <li><code>#child:foo</code> on the second-level children.</li>
  <li><code>#foo</code> on the third-level children.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, use <code>~child:child:child:foo</code> if dealing with relations.</p>
<p>Do note that same as simple copying inheritance, the changes will not
  apply retroactively to existing notes in the hierarchy, it will only apply
  to the newly created notes.</p>
<h2>Template Inheritance</h2>
<p>Attributes can also be inherited from&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_KC1HB96bqqHX">Templates</a>.
  When a new note is created using a template, it inherits the attributes
  defined in that template. This is particularly useful for maintaining consistency
  across notes that follow a similar structure or function.</p>
