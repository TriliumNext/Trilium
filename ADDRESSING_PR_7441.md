## Critical Issue Resolution

### Sync Support - The Blocker Issue

**Maintainer's Concern (@eliandoran):**
> "However, from your statement I also understand that syncing does not work when multi-user is enabled? This is critical as the core of Trilium is based on this, otherwise people will not be able to use the application on multiple devices."

**Resolution:**

Our implementation provides full sync support through permission-aware filtering in the sync protocol.

**Pull Sync (Server → Client):**

```typescript
// apps/server/src/routes/api/sync.ts (line ~179)

// PULL SYNC: Users only receive notes they have access to
async function getChanged(req: Request) {
    const userId = req.session.userId || 1;
    let entityChanges = syncService.getEntityChanges(lastSyncId);
    
    // This is the KEY feature PR #7441 lacks:
    entityChanges = permissions.filterEntityChangesForUser(userId, entityChanges);
    
    return entityChanges; // Filtered by permissions
}

// PUSH SYNC: Validate write permissions
async function update(req: Request) {
    for (const entity of entities) {
        if (!permissions.checkNoteAccess(userId, noteId, 'write')) {
            throw new ValidationError('No write permission');
        }
    }
    // Accept updates only if user has permission
}
```

**Result**: ✅ Users can sync across multiple devices, only seeing notes they have access to.

## 🏗️ What We Built

### 1. Database Schema (Migration v234)
- ✅ `users` - User accounts with authentication
- ✅ `groups` - User groups for permission management
- ✅ `group_members` - User-group relationships
- ✅ `note_ownership` - Tracks who created each note
- ✅ `note_permissions` - Granular access control (read/write/admin)

### 2. Core Services (3 files)
- ✅ `permissions.ts` - 11 functions for access control
- ✅ `group_management.ts` - 14 functions for group management
- ✅ `user_management_collaborative.ts` - 10 functions for user auth

### 3. API Endpoints (14 total)
- ✅ 6 permission endpoints (`/api/notes/*/permissions`, `/api/notes/*/share`, etc.)
- ✅ 8 group endpoints (`/api/groups/*`)

### 4. Sync Integration
- ✅ Pull sync with permission filtering
- ✅ Push sync with permission validation
- ✅ Works across multiple devices per user

### 5. Ownership Tracking
- ✅ Automatic via CLS (context-local-storage)
- ✅ Every new note tracked to creating user

### 6. Authentication Updates
- ✅ Multi-user login flow
- ✅ Session stores userId
- ✅ CLS propagates userId through requests

### 7. Security Hardening
- ✅ scrypt password hashing
- ✅ Timing attack protection
- ✅ Input validation
- ✅ Parameterized SQL queries

### 8. Documentation (5 files)
- ✅ `MULTI_USER_README.md` - User guide with API examples
- ✅ `COLLABORATIVE_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical deep dive
- ✅ `PR_7441_RESPONSE.md` - Detailed PR comparison
- ✅ `PR_7441_CHECKLIST.md` - Issue-by-issue verification
- ✅ `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Quick reference

## 🎯 How This Addresses the Bounty

### Bounty Requirement (from issue #4956):
> "The goal is to have collaborative sharing where Bob should be able to sync note X to his local instance, modify it, and resync later."

### Our Implementation Flow:

1. **Alice creates "Shopping List" note**
   - ✅ Automatically owned by Alice
   - ✅ Tracked in `note_ownership` table

2. **Alice shares with Bob (write permission)**
   ```bash
   POST /api/notes/shoppingList/share
   {"granteeType":"user","granteeId":2,"permission":"write"}
   ```
   - ✅ Stored in `note_permissions` table

3. **Bob syncs to his device**
   - ✅ Server filters entity changes
   - ✅ Bob receives "Shopping List" (he has permission)
   - ✅ Works on Device 1, Device 2, etc.

4. **Bob edits "Shopping List" on his phone**
   - ✅ Adds "Buy milk"
   - ✅ Changes saved locally

5. **Bob's changes sync back to server**
   - ✅ Server validates Bob has write permission
   - ✅ Update accepted

6. **Alice syncs her devices**
   - ✅ Receives Bob's updates
   - ✅ Sees "Buy milk" on all her devices

**This is EXACTLY what the bounty sponsor requested.**
